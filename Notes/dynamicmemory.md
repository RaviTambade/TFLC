#  Dynamic Memory Allocation

*"Come close, my students. Today, I’ll introduce you to someone magical.
His name is... **Memory** — but not the kind you carry in your head."*
This one lives inside your computer.

You see, most of the time in C, we tell the compiler ahead of time,
"Hey, I’ll need 10 integers."
And it politely reserves that space for you, neat and clean.

But what if...

🧩 You don’t know how many values the user will enter?
🧩 Or you want to grow or shrink your data structures during the program?

That’s when Memory whispers…

> *“Tell me what you need... while you're running. I’ll reshape myself.”*

This ability is called **Dynamic Memory Allocation**. Let’s journey through it.

### 🌱 Act 1: The Birth of Memory – `malloc`

Once, a student named Meera wanted to take student names during runtime.

But how many students will join her course? No clue. Could be 5, could be 50.

Her mentor smiled and said:

> “Use `malloc()` — it's like building your classroom only *when* students arrive.”

```c
int *marks = (int *)malloc(5 * sizeof(int));
```

Here, Meera reserved memory for 5 integers.
But the memory was **uninitialized** — the values could be garbage.

### 🧼 Act 2: The Cleaner – `calloc`

Then came her friend Aarav, who was more organized.

He said,

> “Why live with garbage? I want my memory clean from the start.”

So he used:

```c
int *marks = (int *)calloc(5, sizeof(int));
```

And every byte was wiped to zero.
Clean. Safe. Ready to use. Just like freshly ironed school uniforms.

 

### 🧩 Act 3: The Transformer – `realloc`

Later, the course became so popular that more students joined!

Meera panicked.

> “I only booked for 5 students. What now?”

The mentor chuckled…

> “Ah, use `realloc()` — Memory can *reshape* itself.”

```c
marks = (int *)realloc(marks, 10 * sizeof(int));
```

Now Memory resized itself to fit 10 students.
But Meera was warned:

> “Hold on tight to the original pointer. If `realloc` fails, you’ll lose the entire class!”

 

### 💀 Act 4: The Ghosts of Forgotten Memory – `free`

Everything went well. But after the course ended, Meera simply left.

Memory stayed behind... like an unused classroom no one cleaned.

This is called a **memory leak** — memory that remains occupied, but useless.

> “Always call `free()`,” the mentor insisted.
> “Say goodbye to your allocated memory properly.”

```c
free(marks);
```

And thus, Memory was peacefully released back to the system.

### ⚙️ Complete Mini-Tale: Hands-on Code

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    int *arr;
    int n, i;

    printf("Enter number of students: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);

    arr = (int *)malloc(n * sizeof(int));
    if (arr == NULL) {
        printf("Memory allocation failed!\n");
        return 1;
    }

    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("Enter marks of student %d: ", i + 1);
        scanf("%d", &arr[i]);
    }

    printf("Entered marks:\n");
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("%d ", arr[i]);
    }

    free(arr);
    return 0;
}
```

### 🧠 Mentor’s Final Advice

Dynamic memory is a powerful ally — but also a strict one.

🔸 **Always check if `malloc` or `calloc` returned `NULL`** — memory isn’t infinite.
🔸 **Don’t forget to `free()` what you asked for.**
🔸 **Use `realloc()` carefully.** Save your old pointer until you're sure the new one worked.
🔸 **Never access freed memory.** That’s like reading a torn page from a burned book.

 

So next time, don’t fear the unknown size.
Whether your list grows or shrinks, trust in **dynamic memory**.
