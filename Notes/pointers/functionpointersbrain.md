# Function Pointers 

 *"When I first built an embedded system for a toll booth, I faced a challenge: how do I design logic that changes based on 'states'? Red light, green light, yellow light… each with its own behavior. Writing `if-else` for every situation was turning my code into a monster. That’s when my senior handed me a scribbled diagram — a state machine — and said, ‘Ravi, let the code behave like a real system. Not a tangled mess of conditions. Use **function pointers** as your state transitions.’"*

And from that day, everything changed.

## 🚦 Example 1: Traffic Light State Machine

Imagine a simple traffic light controller with 3 states:

* **Red**
* **Green**
* **Yellow**

Each state has:

* An action (what to do)
* A transition (what comes next)

We’ll simulate each state as a function, and use a **function pointer** to move between them dynamically.

### ✅ Step-by-Step Traffic Light Example

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h> // for sleep()

// Declare function pointer type
typedef void (*StateFn)();

// Forward declarations
void stateRed();
void stateGreen();
void stateYellow();

// Start with red light
StateFn currentState = stateRed;

void stateRed() {
    printf("🚦 RED light - STOP\n");
    sleep(1);
    currentState = stateGreen;
}

void stateGreen() {
    printf("🚦 GREEN light - GO\n");
    sleep(1);
    currentState = stateYellow;
}

void stateYellow() {
    printf("🚦 YELLOW light - GET READY\n");
    sleep(1);
    currentState = stateRed;
}

int main() {
    printf("Traffic light state machine starting...\n");
    for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        currentState();  // Call the current state function
    }
    return 0;
}
```

 *“Notice what’s happening here? Each state knows what to do — and who comes next. The main program just loops and calls `currentState()`. That’s clean, reusable, and matches exactly how traffic lights behave in the real world.”*

## 🥤 Example 2: Vending Machine State Machine

Now let’s switch scenes — to a vending machine.

**States:**

1. **Idle**: Waiting for user
2. **Selection**: User selects an item
3. **Payment**: Payment is processed
4. **Dispense**: Item is dispensed

Let’s simulate this too:

### 🧾 Vending Machine Code

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

// Define states
typedef void (*StateFn)();

void stateIdle();
void stateSelect();
void statePayment();
void stateDispense();

StateFn currentState = stateIdle;
char selectedItem[20];

void stateIdle() {
    printf("\n[IDLE] Waiting for user input...\n");
    currentState = stateSelect;
}

void stateSelect() {
    printf("[SELECT] Choose an item (tea/coffee): ");
    scanf("%s", selectedItem);
    if (strcmp(selectedItem, "tea") == 0 || strcmp(selectedItem, "coffee") == 0) {
        currentState = statePayment;
    } else {
        printf("Invalid item. Returning to idle...\n");
        currentState = stateIdle;
    }
}

void statePayment() {
    int amount;
    printf("[PAYMENT] Insert Rs.10 for %s: ", selectedItem);
    scanf("%d", &amount);
    if (amount == 10) {
        currentState = stateDispense;
    } else {
        printf("Insufficient payment. Returning to idle.\n");
        currentState = stateIdle;
    }
}

void stateDispense() {
    printf("[DISPENSE] Enjoy your %s! ☕\n", selectedItem);
    currentState = stateIdle;
}

int main() {
    printf("Welcome to the Smart Vending Machine 🥤\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        currentState();  // Call the current state
    }
    return 0;
}
```


 *“You see, my dear learners — you’re no longer writing instructions. You’re designing behavior. This isn’t just C programming… this is building a mini-robot brain, using the concept of states and function pointers.”*

 

## 💎 Benefits of State Machines with Function Pointers

* 🔄 **Cleaner flow control** — No nested `if` or `switch`.
* 🧩 **Modular design** — Each state is isolated, testable.
* 🔌 **Easily extendable** — Add new states without changing old logic.
* 💡 **Matches real-world systems** — traffic lights, vending machines, elevator logic, UI navigation…


> *“In C, we may not have objects or classes, but we have the raw power of **functions** and the elegance of **pointers**. And when you combine them… you create machines that think in state
